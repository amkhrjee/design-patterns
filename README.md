# design patterns code examples
<img alt="GitHub code size in bytes" src="https://img.shields.io/github/languages/code-size/amkhrjee/design-patterns">

This repo contains source code illustrating different design patterns. Although for the most part the code resemble the code examples provided in the highly recommended book "Head First Design Patterns", published by O'Reilley, I have made my own changes to the code wherever I found necessary. Therefore, this repo is in no way an honest refernce for the code examples provided in the HFDP book.

This repo is meant to be a reference for folks who already have a basic idea about the design patterns, therefore, the code are not commented enough (PRs are welcome!) for someone unfamiliar with the design patterns and principles.
